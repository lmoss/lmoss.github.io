# Invitation to Computability 

 Lawrence S. Moss

This is an online textbook on the basics of computability theory, originating in classes given by the author at Indiana University for quite a few years.  In some way, the content is standard, and in some ways it is not. It treats the basic topics of the subject: the concept of computability, primitive recursion, mu-recursion, universal functions, the Enumeration Theorem, the Recursion Theorem, and undecidability in computability theory, mathematics, and logic.

On the other hand, aspects of the presentation are new.  This is mainly due to the online format using Jupyter notebooks.  The first part of the course uses a variant of register machines using two symbols and a "programming language" using those same two symbols, called 1#.  This text comes with a Python interpreter for 1# and with tool support to enable students to learn to write programs.  In addition, it is posisble to write explicit universal programs, self-writing programs, and similar artifacts.  So the course is much more explicit than most treatments.   At the same time, it enables one to go further, showing the undecidability of tiling using 1#, and then deriving as a corollary Church's Theorem that satisfiability in first-order logic is undecidable.

The chapters in the book are Jupyter notebooks.   So rather than simply read, they are intended to be *run*.
